## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Scss
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project I learned how to use gap with flexbox. I found it to be very easy to use and convenient.

```css
.main__container--cards {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin-top: 1.75rem;
}
```

### Continued development

After learning about the gap property I will work on getting more familiar with all that flexbox and grid has to offer.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/gap/) - This helped me learn more about the gap property. I really liked this resource because It was clear and straight forward.
